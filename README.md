# Discord-Token-Creator
An open-source and free token creator that used to work, but due to discord enforcing captchas it does not work anymore.

## Usage

THIS DOES NOT WORK DUE TO CAPTCHAS, THEREFORE DO NOT EXPECT IT TO WORK. I AM RELEASING THIS SIMPLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LOOKING INTO THIS TYPE OF THING.

Please do not ask me how this works, or how to get this to work as said above, I am releasing this for people who are trying to get a token creator to work. Depending on your python installation your commands may vary. Below are the commands you should run before execution.

The script was tested in python 3.8.6

```
git clone https://github.com/LocalsGitHub/Discord-Token-Creator.git
cd Discord-Token-Creator
pip install -r requirements.txt
py tokencreator.py
```
